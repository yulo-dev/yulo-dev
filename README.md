 ☀️**Hi, I’m Yulo** 

    I'm a full-stack developer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Engineering at the University of Washington.  
    Before grad school, I worked in backend automation and data systems in the clinical research industry — 
    building pipelines that prioritized clarity, traceability, and reliability.
    
    I now focus on building full-stack web apps and developer tools that deliver clear UX and robust backend infrastructure — 
    from Chrome extensions to lightweight AI-integrated platforms using LLMs, embeddings, and prompt engineering.
<br>

💡 **Currently building:**

- Pinception – a Chrome extension for saving and organizing AI prompts  
- Excel automation tools with AI integrations (LLM, NLP)
- Full-stack web apps with thoughtful UX + scalable backend
- Cloud deployment with Vercel (and exploring AWS for backend workflows)
<br>

🎓 **Background**

- M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering @ UW  
- 5+ years in backend & clinical data automation 
- Now focused on SWE internships and applied AI tooling, with a track record of empathetic communication and cross-functional collaboration.
<br>

🫶 **Open to collaboration**

    I'm currently open to 2026 software engineering internship opportunities — 
    particularly in AI-powered full-stack, backend, or platform engineering roles.
